    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>10/02/2024</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>This project aims to develop software that will scrape websites and provide results based on user-entered prompts. Users can enter a keyword or a full sentence. The query will be processed by a lightweight local LLM, which will extract certain keywords from the query.</p>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>Query: "Explain Python. What are its advantages and disadvantages?"</p>
    <h4>Keywords:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Python Advantages</li>
        <li>Python Disadvantages</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The software will scrape the website and list all sentences containing "Python," "Python Advantages," and "Python Disadvantages." These sentences will then be processed by the LLM to provide a result. The software will only provide an answer if the website contains information about the specific keyword. If not, it will ignore the prompt and address the remaining parts of the query.</p>

    <p>The challenge is to choose the best LLM for this purpose. LLMs between 50 - 100MB are preferred.</p>

    <p>This project will primarily be developed in Python using the Scrapy and Selenium libraries. Later, some parts of the software may be written in C++ to optimize speed.</p>
