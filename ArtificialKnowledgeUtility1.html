<h1>Artificial Knowledge Utility</h1>

<h2>This project aims to develop a web-crawling-based LLM that will present information of a certain website. The idea is simple:</h2>

    <li>Develop a custom web crawler.</li>
    <li>Create a web scraper using the web crawler.</li>
    <li>Write an engine that functions as an interface between the data collected by the web scraper and the LLM, which will provide more accurate answers by correcting grammar and semantics.</li>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <li>I will need to develop an algorithm to filter websites and crawl only the most relevant ones. I will create one and update it here in a week or two.</li>
    <li>This step is relatively easy to accomplish.</li>
    <li>I will need to conduct research on this topic first. I will provide an update later.</li>

<p><i>(Note: This project aims to develop a simple web-based chatbot designed for a specific website.)</i></p>
